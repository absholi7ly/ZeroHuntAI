# üìñZeroHuntAI - AI-Powered Zero-Day Vulnerability Scanner
ZeroHuntAI is an advanced, modular, and extensible source code vulnerability scanner designed to detect zero-day exploits and security weaknesses in local directories or GitHub repositories. Leveraging static code analysis, pattern matching, and AI-driven risk scoring, ZeroHuntAI empowers developers and security researchers to identify and mitigate threats like RCE, SQL Injection, XSS, and more.

## ‚ú® Key Features
* Multi-Mode Scanning:
* Local Scanner: Recursively analyzes .py, .php, .js, .java, .c, .cpp, .go, and more.
* GitHub Scanner: Clones and scans repositories directly from URLs.
* Buffer Overflow, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, XSS, Authentication Flaws, Logic Bugs, and more.
* Extracts secrets from .env and configuration files.
* AST-based parsing for deep code insights.
* Regex pattern matching for risky functions (e.g., eval(), system(), mysqli_query()).
* Contextual vulnerability detection and data flow analysis.
* AI Risk Scoring:
* Mock LLM evaluation (placeholder) to classify risks as High, Medium, or Low.
* Future-ready for integration with models like GPT-4 or LLaMA.
* Exploitation Simulation:
* Runs simulated exploits (e.g., SQLi, XSS) in an isolated Docker environment.
* User Experience:
* CLI with colored output (via rich or colorama).
* Web dashboard for interactive report browsing.
* Exploitation Simulation Engine:
* Simulates exploits in a Docker sandbox and reports success (‚úÖ) or failure (‚ùå).
* Data Flow & Taint Analysis:
* Tracks variables from input to execution using tools like Bandit or Semgrep.
* Auto PoC Generator:
* Generates Python/Bash exploit scripts and PDF reports for each vulnerability.
* API Endpoint Analysis:
* Extracts and tests endpoints for IDOR, SSRF, and Auth Bypass.
* Interactive Call Graph:
* Visualizes function relationships and data flow in an HTML graph.
* Highlights exploitable paths in red.
* Call Graph
* Finds API keys, tokens, and sensitive data in code or configs.
* Integrates with CVE feeds to cross-check findings.
* Generates random payloads to test for Buffer Overflows and Logic Bugs.
* Auto Patch Generator:
* Suggests secure code fixes for detected issues.

## Reporting:
* JSON and HTML reports with detailed findings.
* Interactive Call Graph & Taint Flow Visualization.
